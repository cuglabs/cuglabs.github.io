After 6 years in the manufacturing industry as a Mechanical Engineer, Geoff Shorts left it all behind to apply his well-developed skills to bigger problems. As a serial problem solver and big thinker, he's using 3D modeling and 3D printing to pursue his passion for inventing meaningful things.  Geoff founded CUG Labs as a boutique experimental and project-oriented consulting organization.

Whether he's designing and prototyping something for you, collaborating with others, or working on his own creations, he always strives to push the boundaries of what's possible while incorporating a little bit of fun.

If you'd like to create something with him, you can email him at geoff.shorts@gmail.com.
